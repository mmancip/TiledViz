<h1>User documentation for TiledViz</h1>

<p>This documentation aims to provide the user of TiledViz with basic knowledge about the interface and how to use it.</p>

<h2>The tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles may contain an image, a video, or other kind of visual data.
<img src="tiles.png" alt="Schematic tile" /></p>

<h3>The hitbox</h3>

<p>On the left side of the tile, the black vertical zone enables to interact with the environment. It will be called the &ldquo;hitbox&rdquo; in the following.</p>

<p>Its color changes according to the current action :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Color </th>
<th> Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Dark red </td>
<td> The mouse is over the tile (only with desktop browsers).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Red </td>
<td> The tile is selected to be swapped with another one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Green </td>
<td> The tile is selected for zoom mode or master-slave mode.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h3>The stickers</h3>

<p>On the right side, a vertical blank zone is designed to show the stickers of the tiles. These are colored squares representing filters or tags given to the tile. Each time they are shown, a legend is also displayed at the top of the screen.</p>

<h3>The handle</h3>

<p>At the bottom left corner, a hand-shaped icon is dedicated to drag and drop actions.</p>

<p>Its color changes according to the current state of the tile:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Color </th>
<th> Icon </th>
<th> Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>White </td>
<td><img src="../images/drag-handle-on.png" alt="Handle-on" /></td>
<td> The tile may be drag-and-dropped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Green </td>
<td><img src="../images/drag-handle-dragging.png" alt="Handle-dragging" /></td>
<td>  The tile is currently draggable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gray </td>
<td><img src="../images/drag-handle-off.png" alt="Handle-off" /></td>
<td> Drag-and-drop is not available at this time.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h2>Interacting with the tiles</h2>

<h3>Moving tiles</h3>

<p>For the movements, the animation and animation speeds can be defined in the config file.</p>

<h4>Swapping two individual tiles</h4>

<p>The tiles are not exactly swapped, rather, the second one is moved next to the first one, and the neighbouring tiles are re-arranged to preserve the coherence of the data.
This action can be undone with the &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; button of the Global menu.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Action </th>
<th> Behaviour on desktop browser   </th>
<th> Behaviour on WildOS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Hover over the first tile. </td>
<td> The hitbox becomes dark red. </td>
<td> The hitbox stays black (the cursor is not detected by design).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Click on the hitbox. </td>
<td> It becomes red. </td>
<td> It becomes red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Hover over the second tile. </td>
<td> Its hitbox becomes dark red. </td>
<td> Its hitbox stays black.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Click on the hitbox of the second tile. </td>
<td> Done ! </td>
<td> Done !</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h4>&ldquo;Drag-and-drop&rdquo;-ing tiles (only on desktop browsers)</h4>

<p>This can be done when selecting the little hand at the bottom left corner of the tile and moving it to its destination. Like with the swap, the two tiles become contiguous, rather than really swapping their position.</p>

<p>When drag and dropping a transparent tile, the tile is ovelapped on the underlaying tile, enabling the user to compare
data by transparency.</p>

<p>Options in <code>config_default.js</code> as well as in the option menu enable to unload the tile when dragging (&ldquo;Move only a
border&rdquo;) or to move them along a grid (&ldquo;Move on grid&rdquo;).</p>

<h4>Swapping entire lines or columns</h4>

<p>The two last options in the individual menu of each tile allow the user to swap the line (resp. column) of this tile
with another line (resp. column) by clicking the same button on a tile of the destination line (resp. column). See
documentation on these icons (in the <em>Tile menu</em> section) for more information.</p>

<h2><img src="menu_horizontal.png" alt="Global menu" /> Global menu</h2>

<p>The menu lies on the left side of the interface. For each option or item in the global menu, the tag menu or the tile menu, the icon will appear white if the option is not selected or used, and grey if it is selected. To select a menu item, you have to click on it. If you entered an option and do not wish anymore to go further with it, clicking on the grey icon will exit it.</p>

<h3><img src="../images/icons/globalmenu/openNodeMenu.png" alt="Icon to open the tile menus" /> Tile menu</h3>

The &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; can be used to combine several keywords. Upon hitting &ldquo;Enter&rdquo;, the tiles corresponding to the keywords are moved to the top, and little stickers appears on their right side to show to which keyword(s) they fit. The legend for the colors is shown at the top right of the interface.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3>Default configuration</h3>

<p>A default configuration is loaded by TiledViz from the <code>config_default.js</code> file. It contains the following parameters
* Colors: for the different stickers (for filters and tags), and markers of state (selected tile, tile to be zoomed, …)
* Tile configuration: how to use the parameters contained in tiles.js
* Behavioural constants: number of tiles, of columns, should they be fixed, spaces between tiles, …</p>

<h3>Custom configuration</h3>

<p>In order to specify custom parameters and to enhance the user experience, it is possible to add in the Case folder a copy of <code>config_default.js</code> (to be named <code>config.js</code>). It is not mandatory to add in this custom file all the parameters from the default configuration file, but one has to be cautious of the syntax when writing those custom parameters.</p>

<table>

<tr>
