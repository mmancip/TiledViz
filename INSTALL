How to install TiledViz ?

You can use default installation with
> ./install.sh > install.log 2>&1

But you may have some configuration to check before doing it:
 1. Docker settings
 2. Postgresql environement
 3. TVSecure parameters in tiledviz.conf
 4. SMTP relay in connection docker if needed.
 
For host part (named TiledViz Secure), you need to install python3
and python packager pip3 (in python3-pip).

Install will create $HOME/.tiledviz directory.

There are two configuration files :
 * envDB for the postgresql parameter en python3 virtual environmeent.
   It will be filled in a file ${HOME}/.cache/envTiledViz  
 * tiledviz.conf will be copied in ${HOME}/.tiledviz directory.

This virtualenv directory will be TiledVizEnv_${DATE} where ${DATE} is the date of
installation saved in envTiledViz.

1. Docker rights

You must first install docker package (at least 17.03 version).

You must be in docker groups (don't forget to relog after and see "id" command
output) to be abble to launch docker containers.

No TiledViz containers are execute with root users for security.

2. Postgresql environment

PostgreSQL service will be downloaded in DockerHub with alpine system.

You can change PostgreSQL port in envDB before install if you need many
postgres-alpine dockers running.
This file is private and keep the PostgreSQL password for the postgres service.

3. TVSecure parameters in tiledviz.conf

You may change the values in tiledviz.conf before installation:
NbSecureConnection is the number of thread pool for TVSecure.
And ConnectionPort and ActionPort are the port for its connections to TiledViz intermediate dockers to HPC machines.

4. SMTP relay in connection docker if needed.

Install will build connection docker if you want to launch connection 
containers. Please add SMTP server (the IP because DNS may not work) parameter (in
replacement of TODO_SMTP) in
TVConnections/mageianconnect/Dockerfile,
if you want to use some automatic email in your scripts.

5. Fill values
For Gitlab Continuous Integration script file .gitlab-ci.yml, we have prepared fill script of the database with old TileViz demo files :
> TVDatabase/filledDatabase.sh


You may create an empty .netrc file for python lower module:
{{{
touch ~/.netrc
}}}


6. ssh parameters
One must have uncomment 
GatewayPorts yes
in sshd config file on the web server.

7. Use debug option in web Connection form.

If you want to build your own TiledViz cases, you may read
TVConnection/TVConnections.py
because it contains initialization and functions for calling in case job. 

This debug option may stop the connection script before you launch your own job then
you can test it manualy.

You may use os.system('/cat_between #Line1 #Line2 file.py') to display and copy/paste
parts of your script in the prompt.
